Project done as part of the course CS135 (Introduction to Machine Learning), Fall 2023, Tufts University.

Collaborators: Riddhi Joshi

Abstract of the project:
<br>
Given a dataset of several thousand single-sentence reviews collected from three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com. Each review consists of a sentence and a binary label indicating the emotional sentiment of the sentence (1 for reviews expressing positive feelings; 0 for reviews expressing negative feelings). The goal is to develop a binary classifier that can correctly identify the sentiment of a new sentence.

<br>

The project has two parts. Q1 is restricted to bag-of-words representation and logistic regression model. Q2 is an open-ended problem. For more details about the project and the dataset, refer to the website: https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/135/2023f/projectA.html
