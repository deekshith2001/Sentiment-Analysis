Project done as part of the course CS135 (Introduction to Machine Learning), Fall 2023, Tufts University.
Abstract of the project:
<br>
Given a dataset of several thousand single-sentence reviews collected from three domains: imdb.com, amazon.com, and yelp.com. Each review consists of a sentence and a binary label indicating the emotional sentiment of the sentence (1 for reviews expressing positive feelings; 0 for reviews expressing negative feelings). The goal is to develop a binary classifier that can correctly identify the sentiment of a new sentence.
